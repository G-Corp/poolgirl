<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
1> application:start(poolgirl).
ok
2> poolgirl:add_pool(test, {my_client, start_link, [{127,0,0,1}, 1234]}).
{ok,5}
3> Worker = poolgirl:checkout(test).
&lt;0.89.0&gt;
4> gen_server:call(Worker, Request).
ok
5> poolgirl:checkin(Worker).
ok
</pre>

where <tt>my_client.erl</tt> is something like :

<pre>
-module(my_client).
-behaviour(gen_server).

-export([start_link/2]).
-export([init/1, handle_call/3, handle_cast/2, handle_info/2,
         terminate/2, code_change/3]).

start_link(Addr, Port) ->
  gen_server:start_link(?MODULE, {Addr, Port}, []).

init({Addr, Port}) ->
  _ = process_flag(trap_exit, true),
  case gen_tcp:connect(Addr, Port, [{mode, binary},
                                    {active, once}]) of
    {error, Reason} ->
      {stop, Reason};
    OK ->
      OK
  end.

handle_call({call, Request}, _From, Socket) ->
  case gen_tcp:send(Socket, Request) of
    ok ->
      case inet:setopts(Socket, [{active, once}]) of
        ok ->
          {reply, ok, Socket}
        Other1 ->
          {reply, Other1, Socket}
      end;
    Other2 ->
      {reply, Other2, State1}
  end;
handle_call(_Request, _From, Socket) ->
  {reply, ok, Socket}.

handle_cast(_Msg, Socket) ->
  {noreply, Socket}.

handle_info({tcp, _, Packet}, Socket) ->
  % Do something with Packet
  {noreply, Socket};
handle_info({tcp_closed, Socket}, Socket) ->
  {stop, disconnect, Socket};
handle_info(Info, Socket) ->
  {noreply, Socket}.

terminate(_Reason, #{socket := Socket}) ->
  _ = gen_tcp:close(Socket),
  ok.

code_change(_OldVsn, Socket, _Extra) ->
  {ok, Socket}.
